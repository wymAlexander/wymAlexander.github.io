  desc: A Gomoku web application based on the AlphaZero model. AlphaZero was published by Google DeepMind in 2017, and I implemented it to power the Gomoku web application, which replaces hand-crafted heuristics used in AlphaGo with deep neural networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to learn how to play games from scratch.
